# Project 1: A CRUD Application - CS 665: Introduction to Database Systems

I'm creating a CRUD Pet Grooming Shop Management System. The application allows customers to easily schedule, update, and cancel appointments. In addition, customers are able to:
- View their pet information
- Browse services the shop offers
- View past appointments scheduled

I plan to implement these key features using a user-friendly interface. The purpose of the application is to help customers who use this pet grooming shop stay organized when it comes to managing their pet grooming appointments, the shopâ€™s services, and their appointment history.

## Technologies Used

- **SQLite** is the database management system.
- **Python Tkinter** for the front-end.
- **DB Browser (SQLite)** to set up the database and create the tables.

## Database Schema

The schema of the database is as follows:

- **Appointments**
- **Customers**
- **Pets**
- **ServiceTypes**
- **Services**
